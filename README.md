# Genome

Genome is just that, my genome as processed by 23andMe.com

I felt this information is cool, and potentially useful, so I open sourced it. 

You may use this for just about whatever you please, however, I do ask that if you do use this information, open a PR and add a file to the "usage" folder describing what you did.
